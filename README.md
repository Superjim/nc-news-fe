# NC-News-FE

## About

The NC-News-fe application provides information on several topics and articles, and allows for various actions such as sorting, ordering, and filtering.

❗ Warning: The backend is hosted with a free provider, which means it takes a few seconds to wake up if it hasn't been used in a while ❗
❗ Second Warning: I recommend you navigate the website through the sidebar only, using the default back function sometimes breaks things, I still have some polishing to do. ❗

All articles, comments and even topics are added and deleted optimistically. This means default values for things like article/comment ID and time posted are assigned a temporary value and immediately created locally, and then updated upon a succesful response from the API. If an error response is recieved, the new article or comments body is updated to reflect this.

Media queries allow the application to be displayed on a range of devices including mobile, tablets and of course widescreen monitors.

The application uses conditional rendering quite a lot, the create article form is a step through form allowing a user to preview their article before submitting. The add topic form takes the user to the add article form upon adding a topic.
